While it only runs on Windows, it can be installed on a Mac either using a virtual machine or via Docker. The first way is to install a virtual machine (VM) using programs like VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, etc. Then you’ll install Windows onto that VM, which requires a payment for the license, and finally, you’ll use the VM to install SSMS. The second option is to install the SQL server using Docker. Microsoft provides Azure Data Studio as a graphical user interface to run the SQL server on Mac. This article covers the second option. Docker is a tool designed to make the creation, deployment, and running of applications by using containers much easier. Below are the following steps to run SSMS on Mac.""",user_id=user2.id)
